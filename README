skype-notifier - script that integrates Skype in Ubuntu Messaging menu

Requires: python, python-skype, python-notify, python-gtk

 - just launch script from terminal. It will launch Skype if it is not running 
   yet, and will display Skype and new messages in Ubuntu Messaging Menu. When 
   you will exit Skype, items in Messaging Menu will disappear
   
 - Use script as a wrapper for Skype application.

   skype-notifier script (don't forget to do chmod uo+x).

   /usr/share/indicators/messaging/applications/skype file with one line in it:
   
   /usr/share/applications/skype.desktop
